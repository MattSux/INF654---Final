This is a DND character creation app that was created by Matt Heilman for his INF654 final project.

It is setup using firebase and has the following functionality.
Manifest.json File
Service Worker File
Handling Service Worker Events
Local Data Caching
Offline Functionality
Firebase Integration and CRUD Operations
User Authentication
Data Storage in IndexedDB
Push Notifications

To use the app you will login, and then click the '+' icon which will open up the character creator menu. Once the character is created it will populate on the main page and you can either edit or delete the character.

You will need to be logged in to see the characters you created and with firebase auth, you can only see the characters that you created.
